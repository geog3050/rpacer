    This function is used for importing a CSV file to our program
    as a list of lists. Each row will be stored as a list. Therefore,
    in a very high level view:
        - Your CSV file will be stored as a list, where each row
        will be a list inside that list:
        CSV FILE CONTENT: [[ROW1 CONTENT], [ROW2 CONTENT], ...]

    :param filename: This parameter is a string that indicates the
                     filename which we import all the content.
    :return        : This function will return a list of lists, which
                     represents the idea explained above.

    Task Objectives:
    1. Reading a file content
    2. Creating a nested list structure
    3. Type conversion

    Note: Be careful that when you read a file content, even though you read a number,
    its type is interpreted as string (str). Therefore, when you are storing numerical
    values, do not forget to convert its type to float here.
    """
    # REQUIRED METHODS (5 points; 2.5 per numbered item):
    # (1) Use open, a for loop over lines, strip(), and split(",").
    # (2) Use float() for both numbers and append each row to a nested list.
    # Do not use csv, pandas, numpy, or any other imported helper.

    ##### Pseudocode #####
    # 1. Create a list to store all pokemons (MAIN)
    # 2. Open the CSV file with given `filename`
    # 3. Read each line
    #       3.1. Since each line ends with new line, do not forget to strip it
    #       3.2. Store pokemon information in a list (POKEMON):
    #           3.2.1. item of the list should be the name of the pokemon (type: str)
    #           3.2.2. item of the list should be the type of the pokemon (type: str)
    #           3.2.3. item of the list should be the health (HP) of the pokemon (type: float)
    #           3.2.4. item of the list should be the base attack damage of the pokemon (type: float)
    #       3.3. Add -i.e., append- this POKEMON list object to MAIN list object.
    # 4. When you are done with reading all lines & storing the information in a list of lists,
    #    return the MAIN list.

    This function simulates a tournament between a list of participants.
    Tournament works as follows:

          is first one to attack, i.e., 3rd parameter of the fight function
          call should be 2.
        - How many games each participant won will be stored in a list. For example,
          if there are 4 participants and they won 3, 3, 3, 3 games respectively. Thus,
